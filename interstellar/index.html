          <h3>Interstellar by Christopher Nolan</h3>
          <p>
            Interstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction drama film directed by
            Christopher Nolan, who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother
            Jonathan. It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica
            Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, and Michael Caine. Set in a
            dystopian future where Earth is suffering from catastrophic blight
            and famine, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel
            through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for mankind.

          <h3>Screenplay</h3>
          <p>
            The screenplay had its origins in a script Jonathan developed in
            2007 and was originally set to be directed by Steven Spielberg.
            Theoretical physicist Kip Thorne was an executive producer and
            scientific consultant on the film, and wrote the tie-in book The
            Science of Interstellar. It was Lynda Obst's final film as producer
            before her death. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot it on 35 mm
            movie film in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm.
            Filming began in late 2013 and took place in Alberta, Klaustur, and
            Los Angeles. Interstellar uses extensive practical and miniature
            effects, and the company DNEG created additional digital effects.

          <p>
            Hans Zimmer, who scored Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy and
            Inception (2010), returned to score Interstellar. Nolan chose not to
            provide Zimmer with a script or any plot details but instead gave
            him a single page that told the story of a father leaving his child
            for work. It was through this connection that Zimmer created the
            early stages of the Interstellar soundtrack. Zimmer and Nolan later
            decided the 1926 four-manual Harrison & Harrison organ of the Temple
            Church, London, would be the primary instrument for the
            score.[45][46] Zimmer conducted 45 scoring sessions for
            Interstellar, three times more than for Inception. The soundtrack
            was released on November 18, 2014.
